+ snap to grid
+ the dialog code is really ugly, think up a better way to organize them and
look into packing tables
+ make the various dialogs actually do something
+ find / create a facing control for the various dialogs that require it
+ finish the object dialog, which is currently in a half-formed state
+ write the platform dialog
+ finish the polygon dialog, which currently needs to invoke the platform dlg
+ change the way platforms are handled and attach them to polygons, rather
than storing them in a separate array.  this will allow really easy, smart
internal handling of the platform data, since it's never referenced by more
than one polygon and it's annoying to have to shuffle them each time we change
a polygon type
+ replace the object blips with object icons (i.e. finish loading those TGAs)
+ make the light dialog do something
+ fix the gtk **CRITICAL thing on start-up
+ remember open/save paths rather than defaulting to the pwd
+ add Shapes reading support, at least for wall textures
+ add ceiling / floor texturing support
+ add Pfhorte- / Obed-style texturing
+ add a terminal editor
+ add light / media library importing / exporting
+ comment those ridiculous algorithms
+ read from merged maps
+ merge maps
+ VISUAL MODE
+ map manager window (grid size, etc.)
+ map height restriction
+ finish the enumerative / bitmask type conversion in MapTypes.ml
+ write polygon tool
+ write annotation tool
+ write object tool
+ write single level undo
+ write multiple level undo
+ add temporary object highlights until the object glyphs are done
+ add Goto... function (i.e. add recenter-on-point function)
+ add placement chunk dialog / functionality
+ add nuke, pave, nuke & pave
+ add polygon types view
+ add ambient / random sounds views
+ add New Level functionality
+ refactor files like Smithy.ml, the ones that just have loads of unrelated
things thrown together
+ add .mli files!
+ throw together a sample map that can be used as the default make run argument
+ read in optimized chunks
+ write out optimized chunks
+ refactor some of the large match statements in the renderer to at least
avoid multi-level matching (match over tuples instead)
+ make render coloring configurable
+ make the filename string in the map header actually meaningful
+ push GTK events in handle_keys in Smithy.ml instead of calling choose_button
directly
+ the OK buttons in dialogs aren't being added properly or something.  what's
wrong is really obvious, and really should be fixed
+ change the select_line_loop routine to use all lists instead of the mix of
lists and arrays, upon second thought using arrays there doesn't actually make
anything faster or slower, and lists are pretty
+ closing the toolbar windows causes gross behavior, it would be sweet if we
could somehow avoid that happening (hide instead of close or something)
+ put strings into Resources.ml or some similar thing for purposes of i18n
+ some kind of plugin interface would be pretty sweet
+ merging points would be sweet
