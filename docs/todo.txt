important
=========
editing:
+ add placement chunk dialog / functionality
+ add 'triggered by' functionality to the monster placement dialog
+ bug: apparently constrain to grid is broken
+ bug: lines read in from map files don't have their length set
interface:
+ /definitely/ stop using internal units in dialogs, ideally just write fixed-point readers and writers and stop using internal units in the program itself
+ "save before exiting" dialog
+ bug: map height dialog doesn't actually work properly, and should be non-modal
+ bug: goto dialog needs error handling

less important
=========
editing:
+ add Shapes reading support, at least for wall textures
+ add ceiling / floor texturing support
+ add Pfhorte- / Obed-style texturing
+ VISUAL MODE
+ add a terminal editor
+ read from merged maps
+ merge maps
+ read in optimized chunks
+ write out optimized chunks
+ don't leave objects outside of a polygon when moving the vertices of the polygon
+ recenter level is unimplemented
interface:
+ write single level undo
+ write multiple level undo
+ holding down space should temporarily enable hand mode
+ cursors for different tools
+ different draw modes should provide a list of already used values (for elevation, etc) - just use a editable combo box here
+ allow shift-click on a highlighted item to unhighlight it
+ arrow keys should move points/lines/polygons around
+ mark origin with an x
+ display highlighted objects somehow
code:
+ comment those ridiculous algorithms
+ finish the enumerative / bitmask type conversion in MapTypes.ml
+ add .mli files!
+ change the select_line_loop routine to use all lists instead of the mix of
lists and arrays, upon second thought using arrays there doesn't actually make
anything faster or slower, and lists are pretty
+ make classes use similar names for similar methods, so we don't have to deal with, for example, point#vertex, obj#point, and anno#location

not important
=========
editing:
+ make the filename string in the map header actually meaningful
interface:
+ apparently we're leaving locations and sizes of fresh windows up to the wm,
which causes bad behavior on other machines.  figure it out
code:
+ some kind of plugin interface would be pretty sweet
+ put strings into Resources.ml or some similar thing for purposes of i18n
+ write polygon tool
