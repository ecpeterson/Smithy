important
=========
editing:
+ add placement chunk dialog / functionality
+ add 'triggered by' functionality to the monster placement dialog
+ bug: lines read in from map files don't have their length set
+ bug: clicking with the fill tool anywhere to the left of a polygon within the y limits of its vertices will fill the polygon
+ bug: sometimes deleting points doesn't work?
interface:
+ "save before exiting" dialog
+ bug: map height dialog doesn't actually work properly, and should be non-modal
+ bug: goto dialog needs error handling
code:
+ everything is quite slow/laggy under windows (something like 6-10x slower than linux)... why?

less important
=========
editing:
+ add Shapes reading support, at least for wall textures
+ add ceiling / floor texturing support
+ add Pfhorte- / Obed-style texturing
+ VISUAL MODE
+ add a terminal editor
+ read from merged maps
+ merge maps
+ read in optimized chunks
+ write out optimized chunks
+ don't leave objects outside of a polygon when moving the vertices of the polygon
+ recenter level is unimplemented
interface:
+ write single level undo
+ write multiple level undo
+ allow shift-click on a highlighted item to unhighlight it
+ arrow keys should move points/lines/polygons around
+ display highlighted objects somehow
+ drawing a new line should highlight the endpoint when done
code:
+ comment those ridiculous algorithms
+ finish the enumerative / bitmask type conversion in MapTypes.ml
+ add .mli files!
+ change the select_line_loop routine to use all lists instead of the mix of
lists and arrays, upon second thought using arrays there doesn't actually make
anything faster or slower, and lists are pretty
+ make classes use similar names for similar methods, so we don't have to deal with, for example, point#vertex, obj#point, and anno#location

not important
=========
editing:
+ make the filename string in the map header actually meaningful
interface:
code:
+ some kind of plugin interface would be pretty sweet
+ put strings into Resources.ml or some similar thing for purposes of i18n
+ write polygon tool
