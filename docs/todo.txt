important
=========
editing:
+ finish the object dialog, which is currently in a half-formed state
+ write polygon tool
+ write annotation tool, make annotations selectable / editable with the mouse
+ map height restriction
+ add placement chunk dialog / functionality
interface:
+ closing the toolbar windows causes gross behavior, it would be sweet if we
could somehow avoid that happening (hide instead of close or something)
+ /definitely/ stop using internal units in dialogs, ideally just write fixed-point readers and writers and stop using internal units in the program itself

less important
=========
editing:
+ make polygon types view capable of setting types
+ add Shapes reading support, at least for wall textures
+ add ceiling / floor texturing support
+ add Pfhorte- / Obed-style texturing
+ VISUAL MODE
+ add a terminal editor
+ read from merged maps
+ merge maps
+ read in optimized chunks
+ write out optimized chunks
interface:
+ write single level undo
+ write multiple level undo
code:
+ comment those ridiculous algorithms
+ finish the enumerative / bitmask type conversion in MapTypes.ml
+ add .mli files!
+ change the select_line_loop routine to use all lists instead of the mix of
lists and arrays, upon second thought using arrays there doesn't actually make
anything faster or slower, and lists are pretty

not important
=========
editing:
+ make the filename string in the map header actually meaningful
interface:
+ apparently we're leaving locations and sizes of fresh windows up to the wm,
which causes bad behavior on other machines.  figure it out
code:
+ some kind of plugin interface would be pretty sweet
+ put strings into Resources.ml or some similar thing for purposes of i18n
