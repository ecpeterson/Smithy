Smithy is written in OCaml and GTK+, which means you will need the following packages installed to successfully compile:

    + ocaml
    + gtk+
    + lablgtk
    + OCamlMakefile

Make.config contains the path to your local copy of OCamlMakefile, which you may have to edit before compiling with 'make' or 'make native-code', or compiling and running with 'make run'.

Smithy is a thoroughly unfinished application, and so it does not contain an actual installation command.  In particular, things standing in the way of actual deployment are:

1) Smithy is currently hard-coded to expect the 'resources' directory to be in the same path as the executable.

These will of course eventually be fixed.
