Build instructions
------------------
1)  Download and install the MinGW port of OCaml from
    http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
2)  Download and install Cygwin from http://www.cygwin.com/, and install the
    binutils, gcc-core, gcc-mingw-core, make, mingw-runtime, and w32-api
    packages along with whatever else is selected by default
3)  Download OCamlMakefile from http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html
    and save it somewhere
4)  Download LablGTK2 from
    http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/lsl/lablgtk.html
5)  Download and install the GTK+ Development Environment from
    http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/ - it should detect your Cygwin
    installation and set things up to use it
6)  Copy bin/lablgtk.bat, lib/stublibs/dlllablgtk2.dll, and lib/lablgtk2/ from
    the LablGTK2 distribution to the corresponding places in the OCaml
    installation from step 1
7)  Open up a Cygwin terminal, go to the lib/lablgtk2/ directory you just
    copied, and run "ocaml build.ml"
8)  Go to the examples/ directory in the LablGTK2 distribution and run
    "lablgtk2.bat testgtk.ml" - this should open up a GTK window with lots of
    tests for the available widgets. If this doesn't work, you've messed
    something up in the previous steps.
9)  In the Smithy source tree, modify Make.config to point to where you
    downloaded OCamlMakefile in step 3
10) Running "make -f Make.win32" should now build the byte-code version, and
    "make -f Make.win32 native-code" should now build the native code version
    of Smithy
